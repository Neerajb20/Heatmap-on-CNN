Heatmap Visualization using GradCAM, GradCAM++, and LRP

Overview

This project implements GradCAM, GradCAM++, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to visualize model interpretability for CNN-based architectures. These techniques help in understanding which regions of an image contribute most to a model's decision.

Features

GradCAM: Highlights important regions using class-specific gradients.

GradCAM++: An improved version of GradCAM that provides better localization.

Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP): Distributes the model's prediction back to input pixels for interpretability.

Supports ResNet, VGG, and other CNN-based architectures.

Includes visualization utilities for heatmap overlays.
